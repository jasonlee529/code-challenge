/**
 * https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/delete-a-node-from-a-linked-list/problem
 * <p>
 * This challenge is part of a tutorial track by MyCodeSchool and is accompanied by a video lesson.
 * <p>
 * Youâ€™re given the pointer to the head node of a linked list and the position of a node to delete. Delete the node at the given position and return the head node. A position of 0 indicates head, a position of 1 indicates one node away from the head and so on. The list may become empty after you delete the node.
 * <p>
 * Input Format
 * You have to complete the Node* Delete(Node* head, int position) method which takes two arguments - the head of the linked list and the position of the node to delete. You should NOT read any input from stdin/console. position will always be at least 0 and less than the number of the elements in the list.
 * <p>
 * Output Format
 * Delete the node at the given position and return the head of the updated linked list. Do NOT print anything to stdout/console.
 * <p>
 * Sample Input
 * <p>
 * 1 --> 2 --> 3 --> NULL, position = 0
 * 1 --> NULL , position = 0
 * <p>
 * Sample Output
 * <p>
 * 2 --> 3 --> NULL
 * NULL
 * Explanation
 * 1. 0th position is removed, 1 is deleted from the list.
 * 2. Again 0th position is deleted and we are left with empty list.
