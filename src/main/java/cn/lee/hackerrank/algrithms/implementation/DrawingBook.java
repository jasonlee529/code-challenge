/**
 * <pre>
 *    Brieâ€™s Drawing teacher asks her class to open their -page book to page number . Brie can either start turning pages from the front of the book (i.e., page number ) or from the back of the book (i.e., page number ), and she always turns pages one-by-one (as opposed to skipping through multiple pages at once). When she opens the book, page  is always on the right side:
 *
 * image
 *
 * Each page in the book has two sides, front and back, except for the last page which may only have a front side depending on the total number of pages of the book (see the Explanation sections below for additional diagrams).
 *
 * Given  and , find and print the minimum number of pages Brie must turn in order to arrive at page .
 *
 * Input Format
 *
 * The first line contains an integer, , denoting the number of pages in the book.
 * The second line contains an integer, , denoting the page that Brie's teacher wants her to turn to.
 *
 * Constraints
 *
 * Output Format
 *
 * Print an integer denoting the minimum number of pages Brie must turn to get to page .
 *
 * Sample Input 0
 *
 * 6
 * 2
 * Sample Output 0
 *
 * 1
 * Explanation 0
 *
 * If Brie starts turning from page , she only needs to turn  page:

 * Untitled Diagram(6).png
 *
 * If Brie starts turning from page , she needs to turn  pages:
 *
 * Untitled Diagram(3).png
 *
 * Because we want to print the minumum number of page turns, we print  as our answer.
 *
 * Sample Input 1
 *
 * 5
 * 4
 * Sample Output 1
 *
 * 0
 * Explanation 1
 *
 * If Brie starts turning from page , she needs to turn  pages:
 *
 * Untitled Diagram(4).png
 *
 * If Brie starts turning from page , she doesn't need to turn any pages:
 *
 * Untitled Diagram(5).png
 *
 * Because we want to print the minimum number of page turns, we print  as our answer.
